# Nutrition: Hardcore Alchemy Edition

Nutrition: Hardcore Alchemy Edition is a fork of the 1.10 version of WesCook's Nutrition mod. It was created for the [Hardcore Alchemy Modpack](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/mod-packs/2900247-hardcore-alchemy-0-4-1-fixing-the-4th-dimension).

By default, Nutrition: HcA edition uses Nutrition's five-food group system: grain, vegetable, fruit, protein, and dairy. Nutrients are highly configurable; the mod allows for the creation of arbitrary player stats which are affected by food items.

There is no dedicated wiki for Nutrition: HcA Edition, however [the upstream wiki](https://github.com/WesCook/Nutrition/wiki) is a mostly accurate resource for how to configure the mod.
